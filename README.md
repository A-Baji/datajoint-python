# Welcome to DataJoint for Python!
The Python version of DataJoint is undergoing major revamping to match the features and capabilities of its more mature MATLAB counterpart. We expect to complete the revamp within a few weeks: August -- September, 2015.

Learn more on http://datajoint.github.io.

DataJoint for Python is a high-level programming interface for relational databases designed to support data processing chains in science labs. DataJoint is built on the foundation of the relational data model and prescribes a consistent method for organizing, populating, and querying data.

DataJoint was initially developed in 2009 by Dimitri Yatsenko in Andreas Tolias' Lab for the distributed processing and management of large volumes of data streaming from regular experiments. Starting in 2011, DataJoint has been available as an open-source project adopted by other labs and improved through contributions from several developers.


## Quick start guide
The current pip version is ancient. We will update it as soon as datajoint release 1.0 is out. 
~~To install datajoint using `pip` just run:~~

```
pip install datajoint
```

~~in your favorite terminal app.~~

~~However, please be aware that DataJoint for Python is still undergoing major changes, and thus what's available on PyPI via `pip` is in **pre-release state**!~~

## Tutorial 
The IPython Notebook-based primer for DataJoint is at https://github.com/datajoint/ipython-notebook-tutorial.
