# Welcome to DataJoint for Python!
DataJoint for Python is a high-level programming interface for relational databases designed to support data processing chains in science labs. DataJoint is built on the foundation of the relational data model and prescribes a consistent method for organizing, populating, and querying data.

DataJoint was initially developed in 2009 by Dimitri Yatsenko in Andreas Tolias' Lab for the distributed processing and management of large volumes of data streaming from regular experiments. Starting in 2011, DataJoint has been available as an open-source project adopted by other labs and improved through contributions from several developers.

## Installation
```
pip3 install datajoint
```

## Documentation and Tutorial 
A number of labs are currently adopting DataJoint and we are quickly getting the documentation in shape in February 2017.

* https://datajoint.github.io -- this is where comprehensive information will be ultimately provided.
* The IPython Notebook-based primer for DataJoint is at https://github.com/datajoint/ipython-notebook-tutorial. 
* https://datajoint.github.com/wiki/wiki -- this where ideas form before they become documentation.
* https://datajoint.gihub.com/datajoint-python/wiki  -- you are welcome to submit questions as well as issue reports.
