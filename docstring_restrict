        Produces a new expression with the new restriction applied.
        rel.restrict(restriction)  is equivalent to  rel & restriction.
        rel.restrict(Not(restriction))  is equivalent to  rel - restriction
        The primary key of the result is unaffected.
        Successive restrictions are combined as logical AND:   r & a & b  is equivalent to r & AndList((a, b))
        Any QueryExpression, collection, or sequence other than an AndList are treated as OrLists
        (logical disjunction of conditions)
        Inverse restriction is accomplished by either using the subtraction operator or the Not class.

        The expressions in each row equivalent:

        rel & True                          rel
        rel & False                         the empty entity set
        rel & 'TRUE'                        rel
        rel & 'FALSE'                       the empty entity set
        rel - cond                          rel & Not(cond)
        rel - 'TRUE'                        rel & False
        rel - 'FALSE'                       rel
        rel & AndList((cond1,cond2))        rel & cond1 & cond2
        rel & AndList()                     rel
        rel & [cond1, cond2]                rel & OrList((cond1, cond2))
        rel & []                            rel & False
        rel & None                          rel & False
        rel & any_empty_entity_set          rel & False
        rel - AndList((cond1,cond2))        rel & [Not(cond1), Not(cond2)]
        rel - [cond1, cond2]                rel & Not(cond1) & Not(cond2)
        rel - AndList()                     rel & False
        rel - []                            rel
        rel - None                          rel
        rel - any_empty_entity_set          rel

        When arg is another QueryExpression, the restriction  rel & arg  restricts rel to elements that match at least
        one element in arg (hence arg is treated as an OrList).
        Conversely,  rel - arg  restricts rel to elements that do not match any elements in arg.
        Two elements match when their common attributes have equal values or when they have no common attributes.
        All shared attributes must be in the primary key of either rel or arg or both or an error will be raised.

        QueryExpression.restrict is the only access point that modifies restrictions. All other operators must
        ultimately call restrict()

        :param restriction: a sequence or an array (treated as OR list), another QueryExpression, an SQL condition
        string, or an AndList.
